## 1. For user:

If you get in trouble with some bugs,  
try to reset your config setting by url paramerter `reset=1`:  
`https://rplus.github.io/pokemongo-shiny/?reset=1`


## 2. For dev:

1. init & install dependency
  ```
  make init;
  ```

2. just dev~
  ```
  make dev
  ```


## 3. For updating shiny list data:

There are many methods for data usage.

### A. (Default) use my google spreadsheet

  just enter my spreadsheet public url into side-panel:  
  <https://opensheet.elk.sh/1l1CXHdge8_2F2ifjMY71f23DJ_98Ei2QNZ9rPdBd8jQ/'pm2026'>

  if you want to update my spreadsheet  
  <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l1CXHdge8_2F2ifjMY71f23DJ_98Ei2QNZ9rPdBd8jQ/edit>  
  click right-top button to send me a request for getting a edit permission.  
  And then, you could help me to update the data easy, that's really great!

  ※  
  If you are not sure whether you will make a mistake,  
  you can copy the spreadsheet to your own Google spreadsheet.  
  And then change the custom data url to your spreadsheet and just give it a try.

### B. use your google spreadsheet

  you need to get the spreadsheet public url, the easiest method is:  
  `https://opensheet.elk.sh/spreadsheet_id/tab_name`  
  just change the `spreadsheet_id/tab_name` with your google spreadsheet page.  
  And then, you could update spreadsheet by yourself.

  ※  
  If your tab name contains number, you must to use `spreadsheet_id/'tab_name123'` instead of `spreadsheet_id/tab_name123`

### C. custom csv data url:

  you can host csv file by yourself, and just enter your csv url into sidebar to apply pm data.

### D. (fallback): use site's csv data

  We don't use it now, but it is a good data source when developing.  
  if you want to update this,  
  just create a PR for this project to update the [`pm.csv`](https://github.com/Rplus/pokemongo-shiny/blob/main/src/assets/data/pm.csv)


PS1:
How to custom data url:
  1. open custom section in side-panel
  2. input the data url in the latest input
  3. choise correct file type (json or csv)
  4. reload to check

PS2:
if you get in a trouble when custom data url, just reset all setting by trigger url: <https://rplus.github.io/pokemongo-shiny/?reset=1>



## Data property

Our data status example for 3 families:  
`<web-url>/?status=1.00101012-4.0111010-7.111203`

* The number before . is **family_dex**, which identifies the family.
* The number after . is **status number set**, and its order is consistent with the source spreadsheet.
* Families are combined using -.

This represents our data status format.

all csv columns/properties:

| property | required? | type | description |
| -------- | -------- | ----- | ----- |
| `family_dex`  | required | number | usally the pokedex of the first pokemon of family,<br>please group together data rows with the same family_dex |
| `debut`  | required | string | shiny form released date.<br>A nonblank value that is not a valid date invalidates the row: the row is not displayed, but its status URL position is preserved. |
| `pid`    | required | string | uni key, image file name.<br>format: `pm25.cFALL_2018`... |
| `group`  | required | string | A flexible string used for grouping; <br>this will be used to sort the groups, and you may append a numeric suffix when needed to adjust the group order." |
| `tag`    | -        | string | tags for pokemon, combine tags with `=`.<br> e.q. `tag1=tag2=tag3` |
| `order`  | -        | number | pokemon position in group, will use `index` when no order number~<br>e.q. set the order to `-1` for baby so that they can be placed at the very front.  |
| `suffix` | -        | string | suffix name, write mega or other types.<br>e.q. `(Y)`, `#7` |
| `style`  | -        | string | custom image style,<br>e.q. `--w:140%;--l:-10%;--t:-10%;`
| `src`    | -        | string | image url, custom image source, will overwrite the image of pid <br> could be https://ooxx.png |

For `debut`, leave the cell blank for unreleased or unused future data. Use a
nonblank non-date value only when an existing row should be hidden without
shifting saved status URL indexes.


※ If you use custom `src`, and try to create a custom `pid`, just follow basic format rules:

1. starts with `pm` + pokedex-number + `.`
2. suffix name: you could write any name for free, but there are some naming rules for tag system if you need
  * `fMEGA` => mega tag
  * `fALOLA` => alola tag
  * `fORIGIN` => origin tag
  * `fHISUIAN` => hisuian tag
  * `fGALARIAN` => galarian tag
  * you could see all rules from `get_default_tags` function in `/src/lib/pm.svelte.js` file.
